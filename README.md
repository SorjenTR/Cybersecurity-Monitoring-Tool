Designed and implemented a modular Python application that reads and processes log files (e.g., network traffic, syslog, authentication logs) to provide actionable security insights such as failed login attempts and potential intrusion detection. The project included problem investigation, network analysis, class diagram design, implementation, testing, and evaluation, with a comprehensive report detailing methodology and findings.
